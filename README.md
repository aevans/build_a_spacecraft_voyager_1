Abstract:
=========

Generate a LEGO brick version of the Voyager 1 spacecraft.


Goals:
======

- Generate various mockups and sample assemblies using LDraw [1] and related tools.
- Generate a final model and render it using POV software.
- Make available the parts list for the final model (subject to available colors).
- Make available the sample assemblies and final model files and rendering scripts.
- Attempt to recreate the final model in LEGO Digital Designer [2].
- Attempt to produce a set of build instructions or an exploded view of the parts used in the final model.
- Encourage others to modify the design and renderings.
- Encourage others to build Voyager 1 from their available parts or find the parts needed.


Approach:
---------

Using Bricksmith [3] and the LDraw parts catalog [4], piece (no pun intended) together parts and sample assemblies that look like the Voyager 1 spacecraft.  Where possible try to match the Voyager 1 look and feel.

Convert the generated LDraw files into POV files using LP3 [5].

Render the POV files using MegaPOV [6].

Note:
-----

I specifically did not search for any existing LEGO Voyager sets or builds so that I could enjoy the challenge of building one myself.
